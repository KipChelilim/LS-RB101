## a method that returns the sum of two integers
  
  # pseudo code
    take two integers
    add them together
    print the result
    
  # formal pseudo code (assume they're not provided by user input)
    START
    
    GET number1

      result = num1 + num2
      
      puts result

## a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

  # pseudo code
    
    take an existing array of strings
    concatenate all elements in array
    display the result
    
  # formal pseudo code
  
    START
    
    SET joined_string = concatenation of existing array

      array.join()
    end

## a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element.

 # pseudo code
 
  take a list
  iterate through the list one by one
    -save the first item in a new list
    -move to the next item in the list
    -for every iteration check the position of the current item
    -if the current item is immediately after the last saved item
      -move on to the next item in the list
    -otherwise, save the current item in the new list
  
  after iterating, return the new list
  
  # formal pseudo code
  
    START
    
    # Given a list of integers
    
    SET new_list = []
    
    FOR EACH item in the list
      READ position of item
      IF position of item == 0
        STORE item in new_list
      ELSE IF position of item is odd
        STORE item in new_list
      ELSE
        go to next item in list
    END
    
    END
    
## a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character
## in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is
## 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given
## character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

  # pseudo code

  take a string
  split string into a collection
  iterate over the string one by one
  for each iteration
    -check if the character matches the search value
    -if the character matches
      -store the current index
      -increase a counter by one
      -check if the counter equals three
      -if it does
        return the current index
      -otherwise, continue
    -otherwise, continue
  after iterating, return nil
  
  # formal pseudo code
  
  START
  
  # Given a string and search_value
  
  SET counter = 0
  SET index = 0
  SET characters = string split at each character without white space
  
  FOR EACH character in characters
    IF character == search_value
      SET index = character.index
      SET counter = counter + 1
      RETURN index if counter = 3
    ELSE
      CONTINUE
  
  RETURN nil

## a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging
## the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the
## even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array
## should become the elements at the odd indexes.

  #pseudo code
  
  create a new empty array
  take two existing arrays
  get the size of the arrays
  iterate 'n' times, where 'n' is the size of one of the existing arrays
  for each iteration
    take the next value from the 2nd array and store it in the new array
    take the next value from the 1st array and store it in the new array
  after iterating return the new array
  
  #formal pseudo code
  
  START
  
  # given two existing arrays
  
  SET new_array = an empty array
  SET stopping_point = size existing array 1
  SET index = 0
  
  WHILE index < stopping_point
    STORE index of existing array 1 in new array
    STORE index of existing array 2 in new array
    
    SET index = index + 1
    
  RETURN new_array
