# Question 1: an error as the false prevents greeting from being initialized
~ wrong: local variable will still be initialized, just not assigned the value;
~     gets assigned nil

# Question 2: should print the hash object, nothing in the code modifies it (and
              puts does not print each element like it does for an array)
~ wrong: informal_greeting is passed the reference to the actual object, not a
~     copy (i.e. the object id of the #[] call and informal greeting is
~     the same). Need to remember that calling a value with #[] is not passing a
~     new string, it's passing the reference. Documentations says "Returns the
~     value..." -> the HASH VALUE (i.e. object), not just the contents.

# Question 3:
              a: no changes to variables
              b: no changes to variables
              c: one, two , three -> two, three, one (! version of gsub)

# Question 4: see hard_1/question_4.rb
