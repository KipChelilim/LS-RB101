# Question 1: [1, 2, 3]
  wrong - pay attention to the variable being called, and lack of ! on .uniq
  also, remember puts does not print the array object, it prints its elements


# Question 2:
  ! is used with booleans to denote "not" (e.g. !true returns false
  ? is used within a ternary if to separate boolean evaluation with the output
    for true & false conditions (true ? "do this if true" : "do this if false")
  
  1) Not equals, used when comparing two values
  2) Evaluates truthiness of user_name then negates it. Unless user_name is 
     false or nil, this will return false

  3) When used after the .uniq method, turns it into destructive method which
     will mutate the caller

  4) See above for description of ternary if
  5) See above for description of ternary if
  6) See #2. Converts user_name into a boolean based on it's truthiness; because
     of the"double negative" - flips boolean result of user_name twice, theres
     no effect after the boolean conversion of user_name

# Question 3: advice.sub('important','urgent')

# Question 4:
    Both mutate the caller
    delete_at() deletes based on position of the provided argument
    delete() removes the character provided as an argument

# Question 5:
  using range (1..100).include?(42)

# Question 6: 
  using a method: famous_words.unshift("Four score and ")
  string concatenation: famous_words = "Four score and " + famous_words

# Question 7: flintstones.flatten
# Question 8: flintsones.assoc("Barney")
